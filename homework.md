# Homework #3

# 1. Feynman Writing Promps
* Objects
    An `object` is a type of information in programming.  It has a name, like our cardboard box would.  It 
    can have other variables in it, it can have functions in it, which are like recipes.  Each of an `object`s 
    functions would be able to access different things that are in the object.  With our cardboard box, it's 
    like a really big coardboard box with a name.  It can have smaller boxes in it that have their own names that 
    belong in the bigger box.  It has tools that are attatched to it, recipes for different things that you would 
    need with this box.  It's like a big fancy toolbox.
* Properties
    A `property` is what you call a variable that's in an `object`.  It is attatched to that object and related 
    to it. It;s like a little storage box inside of a larger box that can hold a bunch of smaller boxes and tools.
* Methods
    `Methods` are functions, or sets of instructions that are a part of an object.  It is related to the 'object' 
    that the method is in and comes right along with it, no matter what.
* for in loop
    A `for in` loop is is a loop that has all of the specificity of a for loop, the loop that will run instructions 
    over and over until the limits are met, like how many times it is to run.  A `for in` loop is different, 
    though, because it loops over and over, each time with a different item in a list of items.  It's like 
    checking a list of names in class and making sure everyone is in class.  You go line by line, looking 
    for the person and stopping when you get to the end of the list.  That is how a `for in` loop would work.  
    It's limits aren't hopw many times to run, but how many items to go over.
* Dot notation vs bracket notation
    `Dot notation` and `bracket notation` are two ways to look for something specific inside something bigger. 
    If you wanted to get a coke out of a vending machine, you would press the button and the coke would come out 
    of whatever position in the machine it is.  That is `bracket notation`.  You are just looking for a thing 
    without knowing it's name, but where it is.
    You use 'dot notation` when you know the name of something that is in something or somewhere else.  Say you 
    are in line at lunch, in school.  You would say to the lunch lady, "I want the mashed potatoes." You are 
    using the name of the thing you want at the lunch counter and not the place where it is.  You could say, 
    if you didn't know the name of the thing you wanted, "Can I have the third thing there?"  You are still 
    asking for it, but you are saying where it is and not what it is.
    **Dot Notation:**
    `lunch_counter.mashed_potatoes`
    **Bracket Notation:**
    `lunch_counter[3rd_option]`

# 2. Fork and clone this repo. When you need to commit use the following commands
    * `git status`
    * `git add-all`
    * `git status`
    * `git commit -m "your commit message#
    * `git push origin master`
    
    **Done!**

# 3. Install dependencies using `npm install`. Run tests using `npm test`.
    **Done!**
    
# 4. Make the tests pass!
    **Done!**
